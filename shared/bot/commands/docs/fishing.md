# Fishing


## Commands

- fish: the basic fishing action
- fishleaderboard
- fishstats


## Migration

Users are allowed to migrate some of the progress they have accumulated with the old fishing. The first time a user uses the new fishing, the user is prompted with a question whether or not the user wants to start fresh or get a boost from the earlier progress. The prompt is asked every time until an answer is given.

Items are turned into exp and added to the user's exp pool. This is converted to some amount of progress [TODO] in the new fishing.


## Classes / playstyles

To allow for more customization based on user's chatting habits and preference, user can choose a fishing class at [TODO]. The class should be allowed to be changed with a cost.

- Slow playstyle: visits chat / fishes maybe once or twice a day, if that.
    - Give more offline time
    - Reward for fishing less often
    - Should still net the least about of fish due to ease of use

- Fast playstyle: fish multiple times a day, often right away when the cooldown is up
    - Reward for streaks: fish within some time of the cooldown being up for more


### Sub classes

To allow even further customizations, users can choose a sub class. Sub class can either further commit to the chosen base class, be a combination of them, or give something new. One can be chosen with some conditions [TODO].

- Name
